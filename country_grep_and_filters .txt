linux pipes exercises


Tutorial
We will practice using pipes and filters with a text file.
Create a .txt file called country.txt.
Add to the file the following text:

england,london,gbp,english 

usa,washington,usd,english 

china,beijing,rnb,chinese 

germany,berlin,euro,german 

france,paris,euro,french 

italy,rome,euro,italian 

canada,ottawa,cad,english/French
Using grep and cut we can show which countries speak english, and all languages they speak.

$ cut -d, -f1,4 country.txt | grep english
Using sort we can sort the countries by the languages they speak in alphabetical order.

$ sort -t, -k4 country.txt | cut -d, -f1,4
Using cut, sort and uniq, we can find all the different currencies used.

$ cut -d, -f3 country.txt | sort -k2 | uniq
Exercises
On the same data set, try to manipulate the data in the following ways:

Get all the countries which do not speak english, and put them in to a file.
$ cut -d, -f1,4 country.txt | grep -v  english | tee -a cuntry.txt
